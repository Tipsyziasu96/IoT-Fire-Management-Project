# Fire Checkmate Introduction
**Fire Checkmate** is IoT Fire management system using Mobius server. It gathers real-time fire-related information from rooms, and displays organized
information through the web. Fire-related information include Temperature, Humidity, Gas level, and Spark. We defined three caution levels. Actuators work
